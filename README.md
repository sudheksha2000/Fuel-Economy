# Fuel-Economy
## 2008th and 2018th year of records of Vehicles
### Project Overview:
In this project, there are two years of records are used. There are so many columns such as Model name, Highway Miles per gallon ,City Miles per gallon , Combined Miles per gallon, Air Pollution Score , Greenhouse gas Score , Vehicle Class, Smart Way and so on. There are 2000+ records of Vehicles in each year.
### What are the libraries used?
1.Pandas
   
2.NumPy
   
3.Matplotlin.pyplot
   
4.Seaborn
### Process before solving the problems:
1.Investigate data

2.Wrangle data : assess and clean data (Incorrect data types, missing data, and inaccurate data are all problems that we'd need to fix before analyzing this data)
### Questions:
Q1: Are more unique models using alternative fuels in 2018 compared to 2008? By how much?

Q2: How much have vehicle classes improved in fuel economy (increased in mpg)?

Q3: What are the characteristics of SmartWay vehicles? Have they changed over time? (mpg, greenhouse gas)

Q4: What features are associated with better fuel economy (mpg)?

Q5:For all of the models that were produced in 2008 that are still being produced in 2018, how much has the mpg improved and which vehicle improved the most?
